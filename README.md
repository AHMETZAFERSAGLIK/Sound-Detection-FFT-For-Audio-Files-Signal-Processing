# Sound-Detection-FFT-For-Audio-Files-Signal-Processing
a)Script that calculates fft for these audio files and plots the fft magnitude.
You can use only one of the sound channels. To make np.fft.fft function work
properly, normalize the signal by dividing it by max(abs(signal))
b) Implementing a basic algorithm (it may contain some machine learning methods
or even just some if-elses) to classify an audio file as belonging to ˙Ilber Ortaylı
or Emrah Sefa G¨ urkan.

You can use different audio files for comparision.
